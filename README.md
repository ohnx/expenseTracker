# expenseTracker

expense tracker iphone + watch app built in like 11 hours some random saturday (edit: +another 2 hours on sunday).
thanks to swiftui for making things fast to build, but also no thanks to swiftui for causing headaches with updating data and stuff.
at least now i can say i sort of understand the update model in swift - enough to hack my things to work.

## target

i made this in Xcode Version 14.3.1 (14E300c) in June 10&11, 2023. So whatever version of Swift/iOS/watchOS was out at the time is the version I targeted (iOS 16 I think). Sorry if you're on an older version.

## does it work?

untested on real devices because my watch auto-updated to the latest watchos which i unfortunately do not have the device support package for right now :/ but on the phone it seems to work fine enough:
